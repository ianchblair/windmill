# windmill
This repository comtains the blender files for motorisation kit for the Airfix/Dapol C016 OO scale windmill.

There are two files, one for the hub, which enables square section hollow brass bars to attach the sails to a 3mm sized N20 motor spindle.
The other provides "orange segments" to permit a motor regulator board (Velleman K1823) to be mounted in the roof of the base of the windmill
